## Built with Lab Website Template

This website was created using the [Lab Website Template](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template) by the Greene Lab.
We downloaded source codes from their repository and modified our contents based on shared templates.
We thank the Greene Lab for developing and maintaining this excellent template, making it easy for research groups worldwide to create professional websites.

The website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://oxford-omni-lab.github.io) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/oxford-omni-lab). Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite Lab Website Template as the original source of the lab website template.)

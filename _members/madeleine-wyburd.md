I am a Postdoctoral Fellow a the [University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/vip/researchers_image/?pure=en/persons/836835), Denmark. As an Associate member of the OMNI Lab, I collaborate with Prof. Ana Namburete on various projects relating to fetal brain imaging from 3D ultrasound imaging.
I completed my DPhil (2018–2023) under Prof. Namburete’s supervision at the OMNI Group. I continued this work as a postdoctoral researcher (2023–2025), further advancing methods for analysing fetal brain development from ultrasound data.

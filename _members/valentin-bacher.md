### About Me

I am currently reading for a DPhil in Computer Science jointly supervised by [Dr. Ana IL Namburete](/members/ana-namburete) and [Dr. Michael Gray](https://ibme.ox.ac.uk/person/michael-gray/), based at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk). I am generously funded by the [Clarendon Fund](https://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon).
In my research, I apply 3D reconstruction techniques commonly used in computer vision to fetal brain imaging. Specifically, I am developing [NeRF](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf)-like models for ultrasound images to remove shadows and artifacts, thereby improving the diagnostic value of ultrasound imaging for fetal brain assessment.

### Educational Background

Prior to starting my PhD, I earned my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering with a strong focus on medical image processing from [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)](https://www.medical-engineering.study.fau.eu). For my final project, I used [known operator learning](https://www5.cs.fau.de/fileadmin/lectures/DLRessources/Introduction_DLCT.pdf) to remove motion artifacts in weight-bearing CT images at [Dr. Adam Wang's](https://profiles.stanford.edu/adamwang) group.

In addition to completing a consecutive Master's degree in Medical Image and Data Processing at FAU, I earned a second double degree from [FAU](https://www.ce.studium.fau.de) and [Università della Svizzera italiana, Lugano](https://www.usi.ch/en/education/master/computational-science) in Computational Engineering/Computational Science.

### Personal Interests

When not working on my research, I spend most of my time outdoors, climbing, hiking, and road cycling through Oxfordshire and the Cotswolds.

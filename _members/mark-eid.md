I am an [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk) DPhil student, jointly supervised by [Prof. Ana Namburete](https://oxford-omni-lab.github.io/members/ana-namburete.html) and [Dr. João Henriques](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~joao/) in the Visual Geoemtry Group (VGG).

My research primarily focuses on 2D to 3D reconstruction of ultrasound images, to help improve prenatal diagnostic capabilities, especially in low resourced settings. I often take inspiration from technqiues used in classical computer vision and gaming, to help tackle the challenges of ultrasound imaging and the relative scarcity of medical data.

Prior to my DPhil, I completed an MEng in Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London.

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing hockey and squash on a regular basis, and whenever possible I love to ski, kitesurf, windsurf, surf and paraglide.

I am a [Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow](<https://www.ntu.edu.sg/research/research-careers/presidential-postdoctoral-fellowship-(ppf)>) at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, working with [Prof. Jagath Rajapakse](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asjagath/). As an Associate member of the OMNI Lab, I collaborate with [Prof. Ana Namburete](members/ana-namburete.md) on various projects related to brain image analysis and machine learning.

From 2020 to 2023, I was a DPhil student in the OMNI Lab, graduating in 2024. For more details and updates, please visit my [personal website](https://pakheiyeung.github.io/).

## Graduate students

Dr. Namburete is a member of the EPSRC Centres for Doctoral Training in [Health Data Science (HDS)](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/study/cdt) and in [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems (AIMS)](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/autonomous-intelligent-machines-and-systems). If you are interested in a rotation in the OMNI Lab, please contact Dr. Namburete directly using the details on her [departmental profile page](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ana.namburete/). We are primarily a computational lab working on algorithmic design for large-scale brain image analysis, so a background in deep learning, programming and/or brain image analysis helps students make the most of their rotation.

If you are interested, please contact Dr. Namburete directly using the details on her [departmental profile page](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ana.namburete/).

## Postdoctoral researchers

We have more data and research ideas than postdoctoral researchers, so are keen to recruit exceptional researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. The lab has expertise in machine learning, brain image analysis, and development of algorithmic pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale.

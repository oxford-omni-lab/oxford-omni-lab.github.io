Our team’s paper, **“Cross‑Modality Comparison of Fetal Brain Phenotypes: Insights From Short‑Interval Second‑Trimester MRI and Ultrasound Imaging,”** has been accepted by _Human Brain Mapping_.

**What we did**  
We compared volumes of eight fetal brain structures from 90 pregnancies with **paired MRI and 3D ultrasound** acquired mostly on the **same day** (mean gap 1.2 days; max 4 days). Volumes were computed using automated deep‑learning pipelines.

**Key findings**

- **Strong agreement** across modalities for the cerebellum, cavum septum pellucidum, thalamus, and white/deep grey matter (good–excellent ICCs and high correlations).
- **Systematic bias** for intracranial volume and the cortical plate: on average, ultrasound yielded **larger values** than MRI for these structures.
- **Limited comparability** for the ventricular system and brainstem, reflecting modality‑specific appearance and field‑of‑view differences.

**Why it matters**  
Second‑trimester neuroimaging underpins anomaly screening. Our results show where MRI and ultrasound measurements can be pooled confidently, and where _modality‑aware adjustments_ are needed for robust clinical and research use.

**Team & support**  
A collaboration between the **University of Oxford** (Department of Computer Science), **King’s College London**, **City, University of London**, and the **Athinoula A. Martinos Center / Harvard Medical School**, with support from the **Gates Foundation**, **Wellcome Trust/EPSRC iFIND**, the **Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Medical Engineering**, and the **NIHR Clinical Research Facility** at Guy’s and St Thomas’.
